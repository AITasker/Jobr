nputs I Used

Job description text you pasted (“dynamic Program Manager…learning domain…”).

Your CV text from the PDF you uploaded (parsed to plain text first).

2️⃣ Keyword Extraction

I read the job description and pulled out two buckets:

Must-have (critical to do the job)

Program/Operations management experience (≥ 2 years)

Problem-solving / execution focus

Stakeholder management & communication

Designing & scaling operational processes

Data-driven approach with Excel/analytics

Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent)

Nice-to-have (preferred but not mandatory)

Knowledge of educational processes / EdTech

Curriculum / content / student-progression experience

Collaboration with academic/content teams

MBA

3️⃣ Matching Your CV

Then I compared those keywords to the plain-text version of your CV.

Matched must-haves

“Program Management | Business Analysis | Agile & Scrum …” → program management

“Led cross-functional coordination…solving bottlenecks…” → problem-solving / execution

“Stakeholder & Client Management …” → stakeholder management

“Directed cross-functional coordination… streamlined workflows…” → design & scale processes

“SQL Reporting | Dashboarding | Google Sheets Automation | Predictive Analytics” → data-driven / Excel-like analytics

“B.Tech, NIT Meghalaya” → bachelor’s degree

→ 6 of 6 must-haves matched

Matched nice-to-haves

PhysicsWallah / UpGrad roles → EdTech exposure

“program schedules, evaluations, learner support” → curriculum / student progression-type work

“Coordinated with academic institutes” → collaboration with academic teams

→ 3 of 4 nice-to-haves matched (missing only “MBA”).

4️⃣ Scoring Formula

I use a fixed weighted formula:

must_score  = (matched_must / total_must) * 70
nice_score  = (matched_nice / total_nice) * 30
ATS_score   = round(must_score + nice_score)


Plugging in the numbers:

must_score  = (6 / 6) * 70  = 70
nice_score  = (3 / 4) * 30  = 22.5
Total       = 92.5 → round to 93

5️⃣ Output

That’s why I reported:

{
  "ats_score": 93,
  "matched_must_haves": [...],
  "missing_must_haves": [],
  "matched_nice_haves": [...],
  "missing_nice_haves": ["MBA"],
  "explanation": "Matched 6/6 must-haves and 3/4 nice-to-haves."
}

Key Takeaways

Deterministic: no hidden AI judgment—just keyword matching + simple math.

Why your app shows 43 %: likely stricter matching, different weights, or parsing issues (e.g., didn’t recognise EdTech experience as “curriculum/student progression,” or failed to parse the PDF text).
