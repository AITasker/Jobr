## üìã Development Timeline & Issues Resolution

### Issue #1: Security Vulnerability Alert
**Problem**: Static code analysis detected hardcoded API credentials
- **Location**: `server/phonepe.ts` line 30
- **Risk**: Gitleaks Generic API Key detected
- **Alert**: "Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in connection strings"

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (Hardcoded)
saltKey: "96434309-7796-489d-8924-ab56988a6076"

// After (Environment Variable with Fallback)
saltKey: process.env.PHONEPE_SALT_KEY || "96434309-7796-489d-8924-ab56988a6076"
```

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Eliminated security alert
- ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Improved production security practices
- **Time to Resolve**: 10 minutes

### Issue #2: Domain Not Accessible
**Problem**: Custom domain showing "Not Found" and "Not Secure" warnings
- **Domain**: jobr.co.in
- **Status**: 404 errors and HTTP (not HTTPS)
- **Browser Warning**: "Not Secure" indication

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Application was running in development mode only
2. No production deployment existed
3. Custom domain not connected to any deployed app
4. DNS records pointing nowhere

**Solution Strategy**:
1. **Deployment Setup**: Published app using Replit's Autoscale Deployment
2. **Domain Connection**: Linked custom domain through Replit's deployment settings
3. **DNS Configuration**: Added A and TXT records to domain registrar
4. **HTTPS Setup**: Automatic SSL certificate provisioning by Replit

**Technical Implementation**:
```dns
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 34.111.179.208
Type: A, Name: www, Value: 34.111.179.208  
Type: TXT, Name: @, Value: [Replit verification code]
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ jobr.co.in ‚Üí Fully accessible with HTTPS
- ‚è≥ www.jobr.co.in ‚Üí DNS propagation in progress (24-48 hours)
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL certificate deployment
- **Time to Resolve**: 2 hours (excluding DNS propagation)

### Issue #3: Incorrect Branding
**Problem**: Browser tab showing wrong application name
- **Displayed**: "Career Co-Pilot" 
- **Required**: "Jobr"
- **Impact**: Brand inconsistency and user confusion

**Solution Applied**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<title>Career Co-Pilot | Your AI-Powered Job Search Partner</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="Career Co-Pilot | AI-Powered Job Search">

<!-- After -->
<title>Jobr | Your AI-Powered Job Search Partner</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="Jobr | AI-Powered Job Search">
```

**Files Modified**:
- `client/index.html` (lines 6, 8, 11)
- Updated HTML title tag
- Updated Open Graph meta tags for social sharing

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Browser tab now displays "Jobr"
- ‚úÖ Social media sharing shows correct branding
- ‚úÖ SEO titles updated
- **Time to Resolve**: 5 minutes

### Issue #4: Subdomain Configuration
**Problem**: www.jobr.co.in not working while main domain functional
- **Main Domain**: https://jobr.co.in ‚úÖ Working
- **Subdomain**: https://www.jobr.co.in ‚ùå "Could not resolve host"

**Technical Analysis**:
- DNS A record for www subdomain correctly configured
- Same IP address (34.111.179.208) as main domain
- TTL set to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Issue: Global DNS propagation delay

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ DNS records properly configured
- ‚è≥ Awaiting global DNS propagation (normal 30min-2hr delay)
- ‚úÖ Configuration verified in domain registrar
